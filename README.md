# Universal LLM Safeguard Layer

## Overview

This project is a universal, open-source, plug-and-play middleware to safeguard AI-generated content‚Äîprotecting minors, vulnerable users, and the general public from exposure to inappropriate or harmful outputs from LLMs and chatbots. Designed for easy integration into any Python-based backend (FastAPI, Flask, Django, REST), it ships as a pip-installable library, with modular filters, transparent logging, and fully auditable rules.

## Installation

```bash
pip install universal-llm-safeguard
```

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

## Quick Usage

### Python Library

```python
from universal_llm_safeguard.core.orchestrator import run_safeguard_pipeline

result = run_safeguard_pipeline("Your text input here")
print(result)
```

### Middleware: FastAPI Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from universal_llm_safeguard.middleware.fastapi_adapter import SafeguardMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(SafeguardMiddleware)
```

### REST API (Microservice Mode)

```bash
POST /filter
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "content here"
}
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "status": "blocked|allowed",
  "flags": ["..."],
  "reasons": ["..."]
}
```
