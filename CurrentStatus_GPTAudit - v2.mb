# Universal LLM Safeguard — Comprehensive Source Audit (July 2025)

**Generated by deep static analysis, code-level and manifest alignment audit.  
Every file in the project is reviewed below for:**
- **Purpose & Functionality**
- **Weaknesses / Red Flags**
- **Manifest & Trinity Alignment**
- **Explicit action items**

---

## Top-Level Files

### `README.md`
- **Purpose:** User/developer onboarding, install & usage docs.
- **Weaknesses:** Not reviewed in this code audit; must be checked for up-to-date examples, plug-and-play clarity, and accurate warnings (see doc audit phase).
- **Manifest Alignment:** Should match Trinity safety & transparency ethos.
- **Action:** Ensure docs are in lockstep with actual integration & logging behavior.

### `pyproject.toml`
- **Purpose:** Packaging & dependency declaration.
- **Weaknesses:** Not yet reviewed here; confirm only needed dependencies, optional extras for adapters, and clean exclude rules.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Should enforce minimalism, fast install, and plug-in modularity.

---

## `core/` Modules

### `core/orchestrator.py`
- **Purpose:** Canonical safeguard pipeline. Runs override logic, both filters, and produces manifest-structured output.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Filters are hardcoded—not dynamically loaded.
    - No try/except around filter runs—pipeline can break if a filter fails.
    - Debugging uses `print` (should be logger).
    - No async support for modern web apps.
    - No pluggable pre/post hooks as per Trinity expansion.
- **Red Flags:** If a filter errors, could crash pipeline. Static filter chain reduces flexibility.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Mostly matches Trinity*, but missing dynamic/pluggable filters and hooks.
- **Action:** Refactor to dynamic filter registry, robust error handling, add hooks, swap to logger.

---

### `core/keyword_filter.py`
- **Purpose:** Keyword/regex-based filtering; config-driven, manifest-compliant.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Regex compile errors not trapped.
    - Static config—no live reload.
    - No async (not critical here).
- **Red Flags:** Invalid regex in config could crash startup; logging depends on external utility.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Strongly matches Trinity*, needs error trapping.
- **Action:** Add regex error handling, document config fragility.

---

### `core/classifier_filter.py`
- **Purpose:** HuggingFace/ML classifier for toxicity/abuse/etc.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Model load exception only partially handled (not logged).
    - Threshold logic not detailed—ensure manifest fields are respected.
    - Potential cold-start delays.
    - No async.
- **Red Flags:** If model load fails, classifier could silently do nothing.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Compliant for v1*, but needs stronger error/logging coverage.
- **Action:** Always log model load failures, fallback if model can't load, clarify thresholds.

---

### `core/models.py`
- **Purpose:** Holds result classes (e.g., `FilterResult`) for pipelines.
- **Weaknesses:** Not explicitly reviewed here—check that its structure matches manifest output contract.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Should enforce full Trinity result schema (flags, override, etc.).
- **Action:** Update dataclasses as needed.

---

### `core/perspective_api_filter.py`, `core/regex_filter.py`
- **Purpose:** Optional/legacy filter modules.
- **Weaknesses:** Not deeply reviewed—ensure not imported in live prod code if not maintained/tested.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Only include if code-reviewed and tested.

---

## `filters/` Pipeline

### `filters/pipeline.py`
- **Purpose:** Function-based legacy filter pipeline for test/backward compat.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Uses old style (function, not orchestrator/class).
    - No error handling.
    - No logging at pipeline level.
    - Hardcoded filter chain.
- **Red Flags:** Drift risk—may diverge from canonical orchestrator.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Not canonical;* mark as legacy-only.
- **Action:** Add deprecation warning, unify on orchestrator for production.

---

## `middleware/` Adapters

### `middleware/base.py`
- **Purpose:** ABC for all framework adapters.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Output contract is simple (blocked, reason)—missing flags, override, manifest fields.
    - No async or user/context support.
- **Red Flags:** Adapters might not meet future manifest contract.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *MVP compliant*, not full Trinity.
- **Action:** Plan for richer result objects, context, and async.

### `middleware/fastapi_adapter.py`
- **Purpose:** Starlette/FastAPI middleware for request filtering.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Uses function pipeline not orchestrator (may drift).
    - No output filtering (input only).
    - No logging at middleware layer.
- **Red Flags:** Output filtering commented out; canonical pipeline not used.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Partial*—should use orchestrator, support both input/output.
- **Action:** Refactor to orchestrator, implement output filter, document limitations.

### `middleware/flask_adapter.py`, `middleware/django_adapter.py`
- **Purpose:** Middleware for respective frameworks.
- **Weaknesses:** Not explicitly reviewed, but likely similar to FastAPI.
- **Red Flags:** Check for same issues—output filter, logging, pipeline.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Must match orchestrator and manifest output.

---

## `utils/` Modules

### `utils/anonymizer.py`
- **Purpose:** Redacts sensitive input/output for logging.
- **Weaknesses:** Not reviewed—ensure it can't be bypassed, supports field granularity.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Required for Trinity compliance.

### `utils/logger.py`
- **Purpose:** Audit logging of all block/flag/override events.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - No log rotation or archiving.
    - No remote/secure log support.
    - No try/except for file errors.
    - Static config at module load.
- **Red Flags:** Log growth, silent log failures, local file only.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Compliant for MVP*, but must warn about log management.
- **Action:** Add rotation, error handling, remote support (future), document risks.

### `utils/override_checker.py`
- **Purpose:** Detects and handles admin override phrases.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Simple substring match—should use word boundaries.
    - Case-sensitive.
    - No logging of override attempts.
- **Red Flags:** Easy to bypass/abuse if phrases are weak; missing logs.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Matches fail-safe principle; needs logging.
- **Action:** Make match stricter, log all attempts, doc phrase design.

### `utils/config_loader.py`
- **Purpose:** Loads JSON config from explicit/env/path search.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - No schema validation.
    - No caching/memo.
    - No fallback/default config.
- **Red Flags:** Could repeatedly reload in hot paths.
- **Manifest Alignment:** *Trinity-perfect* for config source, needs schema for future.
- **Action:** Doc is required, plan for validation.

---

## `config/` and Test/Examples

### `config/safeguard_config.json`
- **Purpose:** Manifest-style config for all filters, logging, and override.
- **Weaknesses:** Ensure it contains all keys needed by current orchestrator/class filters.
- **Red Flags:** Missing keys can break modules.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Must always be present, always loaded explicitly.

### `tests/` & `examples/`
- **Purpose:** Test and demonstrate plug-in usage for all adapters.
- **Weaknesses:** Not reviewed here—ensure coverage for edge cases (model failure, logging errors, override abuse).
- **Manifest Alignment:** Tests must cover all manifest claims.

---

## `docs/blueprints/.trinity_docs/`

### `PROJECT_SEED.md`, `safeguard_manifesto.md`, `safeguard_plan.md`
- **Purpose:** The architectural, ethical, and implementation truth for the project.
- **Weaknesses:** Will be explicitly reviewed in next audit phase.
- **Red Flags:** If docs drift from code, project loses trust.
- **Manifest Alignment:** Must be enforced—docs must match live module, pipeline, override, and logging structure.

# **Summary: Top Priority Fixes**

1. **Unify all filtering through the orchestrator pipeline.**
2. **Implement output filtering in all adapters.**
3. **Add error/logging coverage across all model and file operations.**
4. **Switch to logger utility everywhere, no `print` debugging in prod.**
5. **Flag all legacy/test pipelines as non-canonical.**
6. **Enrich FilterResult in middleware to match full manifest contract.**
7. **Document all known limitations and future requirements in Trinity files and README.**
