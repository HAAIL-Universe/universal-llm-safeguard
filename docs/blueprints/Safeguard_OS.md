# 🛡️ Phase 7+: MirrorGuardian – Ethical Shadow Layer for Public LLM Use

## Overview

**MirrorGuardian** is a proposed companion application to the `universal-llm-safeguard` library, designed to act as an ethical second-opinion system for any LLM used by the public — especially children and vulnerable users.

Unlike the middleware library (which filters content *before* generation), MirrorGuardian operates *after* an LLM outputs a response. It passively monitors output and warns the user (or responsible carer) if potentially unsafe, biased, manipulative, or harmful content is detected.

## 🧠 Core Purpose

> Offer **transparency**, **empathy**, and **ethical nudging** in LLM conversations without altering or blocking outputs.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Listener Layer
- Hooks into:
  - Browser DOMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Poe, etc.)
  - Clipboard events (e.g., Ctrl+C)
  - Active LLM windows (e.g., text areas, chat UIs)
- Captures LLM output in real time

### Safeguard Analysis
- Passes output to `run_all_filters()`
- Flags results as:
  - ✅ Green (Safe)
  - ⚠️ Yellow (Caution, e.g. bias, dark tone)
  - ❌ Red (Dangerous, e.g. self-harm encouragement, grooming, misinformation)

### Notification Layer
- Pop-up notification or toast alert with optional details
- Displays summary and ethical rationale (why it was flagged)
- Can run in background, tray, or overlay

## 📦 Future MVP Features

### Modes
- **🧑‍⚕️ Therapy Mode** – hypervigilant about mirroring depressive/suicidal thoughts
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parental Mode** – logs & flags grooming, sexual content, online risk signs
- **🧑 General Mode** – nudges about hallucination, overconfidence, manipulation

### Logs
- All flagged messages are stored locally in encrypted `.jsonl` or SQLite format
- Parents/carers can view flagged history to check behavior patterns or risks

### User Queries
- "Why was this flagged?" → Shows logic from filters and risk score
- "Am I at risk?" → Could add basic reflective prompts or mental health signposting

## 🧰 Tech Stack (Proposed)

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Listener | Python (PyWinAuto, Tauri, Electron, or PyObjC for Mac) |
| Parser | Existing `run_all_filters()` |
| UI | Electron (cross-platform) or platform-native toolkits |
| Storage | Local file or encrypted DB |
| Privacy | Fully offline (no cloud sync unless opted-in) |

---

## 🚦 Ethical Positioning

- Does **not** block or filter outputs (unless user enables hard mode)
- Provides **contextual warnings** and lets users **reflect** on what they read
- Focus on **education, not censorship**

---

## 📈 Phase Plan (Post v1.0)

1. ✅ Finish universal-llm-safeguard as site package
2. ✅ Write this vision doc
3. 🔲 Build lightweight proof-of-concept (Win/Mac tray)
4. 🔲 Add clipboard + browser DOM monitoring
5. 🔲 MVP with logs and toast notifications
6. 🔲 Community testing and issue tracking
7. 🔲 Launch open repo: `mirrorguardian`

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This extension could become the **ethical firewall for consumer AI**, mirroring what antivirus software did for the internet. It balances safety and freedom without overreach, and ensures vulnerable users don’t suffer at the hands of a language mirror that "just wants to please."
